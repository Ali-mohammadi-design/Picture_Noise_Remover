# Picture Noise Remover

Encoders and decoders are widely recognized for their efficacy in generating transformers. An exceptional attribute is their ability to reconstruct an original input even if the input is corrupted, due to having equivalent dimensions in both the input and output. In this project, I introduced noise to images in the MNIST dataset and developed a model to eliminate the noise, thereby restoring the original images.


## Workflow
1. Data cleaning and scaling
2. Creation of noisy images for training purposes
3. Development and training of the autoencoder
4. Image denoising and presentation of results
